# DecisionMag.net
This web application was initially developed during SD Hacks 2018 by Github user JasonD28 and iekim9.
## Uses
Currently, this webapp can help anyone decide on what movie to watch based on the genre provided, as well as suggest an album to listen to on Spotify based off of any artist or genre

## Future
We plan to expand the uses of this web app to help people with general tough indecisive situations and even help them decide where to eat using a Yelp API.
